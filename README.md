Feature:
1)Data shown here is live data use api I get this live data in form of json object
2)In this app I use recycler view to show 48 hour data to save memory of user rather than taking full data.
3)I also use circular seekbar to shown sunrise or sunset.
4)And I also use swipe layout for refresh data by swipping screen.
5)You can search your city my going to search bar activity.
